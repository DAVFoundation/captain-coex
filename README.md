# captain-coex

Captains are the connectors between the DAV network, and our various partners. `captain-coex` connects between the DAV network and the autonomous delivery drones built by [Copter Express](http://www.copterexpress.com/), responding to requests for deliveries from users, telling the drones where to fly, when to land, and how to complete delivery missions.
